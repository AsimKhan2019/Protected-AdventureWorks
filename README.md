# Adventure Works Sales Sample

This is a sample line-of-business solution that demonstrates the use of Runtime Checks, a security feature offered by Dotfuscator Community Edition, which is included with Visual Studio 2017.

The solution is based on the AdventureWorks2014 OLTP database sample for Microsoft SQL Server.
The solution contains two apps:

* *AdventureWorksSalesService*: An ASP.NET web service that exposes customer data from the database, and
* *AdventureWorksSalesClient*: A WPF desktop client that interacts with that web service.
